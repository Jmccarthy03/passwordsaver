    Ok boys, I admit it, it is hard to get a girlfriend. Girls can be very difficult to control, but with this article, you’ll be a pro with the girls. “The Rizzler”, as the teenagers these days say. Make sure to do everything that I say. Trust me, this is the best way.
  The first thing you’ll need to do is make sure the girl you want knows you exist. If you happen to be friend with this girl, great. Give her a jar of pickled eggs (every girl loves them, trust me). Now if you don’t know this girl, always make sure to sprint towards her from a far distance away. Once you are all up in her face, give a big, wide, Chester Cat-like smile (girls love boys with confidence) and say something along the following lines (make sure to have your hand of her shoulder): “Hello, I was just over there and I saw how beautiful you look. My name is (your name), it is VERY nice to meet you.” Once you say something like that, this girl you just met will be absolutely, literally and metaphorically, drooling over you. Make sure to give oddly specific compliments that make no sense like “You have amazing elbow dexterity” or “It is amazing how you’ve been able to keep all your fingers after all these years.” Soon enough, your first date will come around.
  First dates are always the hardest. You don’t want to be too formal but you also don’t want to be too casual. Usually, girls stress over first dates so say to her that you are her are going somewhere nice. Once she is all dressed out in her pretty dress and you dressed out in your tuxedo with crocs and athletic shorts, go to McDonald’s (everyone loves McDonald’s) because you forgot that you were broke and didn’t have enough money to buy something nice. After your very romantic dinner of sharing the dollar menu with your new girlfriend, make sure to take the longest route back to her house, maybe you could tell her a bizarre story about how you one time ate a four pound bag of Sour Patch Kids. Once your girl is back at her house, congratulations, you have survived your first date.
  At this point, your relationship with your new girlfriend will be unbreakable if you followed exactly what I said and not what your friends, family, or other people with common sense tell you. Make sure to give your girlfriend gifts like: a screaming jar of peanuts, a bunch of black bananas, cheeseburger in a can, a rock that looks like a face, or even the classic jar of pickled eggs. Lastly, after about a year, take your girl somewhere nice, like an island in the middle of the ocean. Of course, you and your girl are in a long distance relationship, so you won’t be on the island (obviously).
  This is all the advice I will give you. I wish you luck (even though you won’t need it).


Bon Voyage!
